# Final-Project
This is the final project for the bootcamp. This is a combination of both project 1 and 2
The objective was to practice a number of different things learned throughout the bootcamp course and to act as a pentester and SOC analyst.

    Implement alarms and thresholds in Elasticsearch Watcher.
    Find vulnerabilities / exploits to gain access to a vulnerable WordPress site / server.
    Use Wireshark to analyze and find malicious traffic on the wire.
    Create a team presentation with the assessment, analysis and hardening of the vulnerable system.
Implement the alarms and thresholds you determined would be effective in Project 2.

Assess two more vulnerable VMs and verify that the rules work as expected.

Use Wireshark to analyze live malicious traffic on the wire.

Read through the Red Team, Blue Team and Network Analysis files to the see the work, process and findings that lead up to creation of the final presetation.
